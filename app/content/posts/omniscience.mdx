## Déjà vu

- codeowner for many, many stacks
- all the stacks are shared
- lots and lots of PRs
- minor changes to PRs require re-approval
- constantly clicking into the same PR to see if I had approved it, or if I needed to re-approve it, etc

## Goldilocks and The Three Requirements

- tried out several existing tools
- had three main requirements

1. close to real-time desktop notifications
2. filtering by label + repository
3. tell me when my review was dismissed

- couldn't find an app that had the combination of features I needed
- The next obvious step was to make my own

- The Plan? Make a quick tool to notify me of PRs that need my attention
- The reality? spend 3 months of my life creating an app that met my potentially very niche needs

## The World Could Always Use More Electron Apps

- I'm a zoomer TS dev & a web dev
  - I don't really want to learn another language and platform just for this quick app
  - also didn't want to use xcode and couldn't be bothered to see if intellij worked with swift + app development
- I risked my public standing and wrote an electron app
  - Reports of its inefficiency are greatly exaggerated
  - If you're using the app you most likely have a decently powerful Mac for coding - hyper optimised performance wasn't really a concern
- I'm not a designer, thankfully shadcn is

- After about 3 weeks of building a bit every evening I had something that met my initial three requirements
- Why stop there? Added a few more nice-to-have features and cleaned up the UI & code
- Before I knew it it had been 3 months and I had an actually pretty nice looking and stable app

## A Real Product

- Outside of my actual work I had never made a _real_ product that could be used by random people I've never met
- How do I tell people about it?
- How do I distribute it?
- How do I justify spending £80 on an Apple Developer account so I stop getting that bloody security popup?
- How can I ensure it's accessible for everyone
  - Authorization via GitHub PAT, no storing/transferring of actual login credentials + granular permission control
  - Electron app so already runs on pretty much anything
  - Making sure accessibility isn't ignored
  - Distribute via App Store & the .dmg file
    - Some companies don't let you log in to an Apple account so the App Store may not be available for everyone
    - Some VPNs block new domains or domains with non-standard TLDs, so downloading a .dmg may not be available for others
      - This also affects auto-updates even if they are able to download a .dmg as it can't programmatically click "Yes I'm fine with going to this site"
    - This could change in the future if I decide to add any features that go behind a paywall (don't worry, nothing scummy, all the features in the app at the moment will remain free) but for now both are available
- The pain of Apple signatures, certificates, notarization, and app reviews
